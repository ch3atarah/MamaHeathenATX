            I've been looking at a lot of pictures setting this all up and it brings me tears of joy when I look at them and see all the wonderful times we have.
            You are such an amazing mother; I have never met anyone like you that puts so much love, blood, sweat, tears, joy, and creativity to make sure that your baby is living her best life and learning how to be a wholesome and caring person in this world.
            I know you love your daughter so much, but it's not only just words.  It's the actions also.  Like making sure you get to spend as much time as possible with her, even when it means turning down things in the near term.
            You also teach her by example of being here today, and if you aren't feelingn it, then it's okay and can try again another day.  You provide not only what she needs, but make sure that Baby Yoda is stimulated and having fun everyday.
            I'm lucky, grateful, and blessed to be apart of this circus.  I know that God put y'all in my life and I in y'alls for a reason and it's been an amazing experience.  I'm so glad I got to do this, because it's given me time to reflect on the amazingness that is Nightmare on Berkeley Street!
            I consider Everett to be apart of me, and she wouldn't be having this amazing life without you.  God chose YOU to be her mom, and he chose a damn good/badass mom.
            I love you, I love Baby Yoda (Everett), and I love our family...(Even if the circus gets ccrraazzyy and wild sometimes)  Thank you for letting me in.
            I have spoken, Heart, Ben the Boogie Man</span></p>
